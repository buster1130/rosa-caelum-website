Rosa Caelum are making waves as they crash onto the alt-rock music scene to take you on a ‘deranged psychedelic joyride’ (Gigslutz). Having already performed at heaving festivals and sold out venues, including two back-to-back headline performances, it’s no wonder ThisIsTheMusic have crowned them ‘an exciting young band to watch closely throughout 2023’.

Rosa Caleum have been dubbed ‘hot prospects on the UK Indie Scene’ by York Calling and have proven their standing with their previous releases ‘The Lovers Were The Last Ones To Leave’ and ‘Jerusalem’ achieving over 32k combined streams on Spotify and receiving airtime on Radio X, BBC West Midlands and BBC Introducing. 

Now they return with their brand new single ‘Heaven Once Told You’ a thunderous performance which illustrates their ability to create thoughtful and intense narrative perfectly immersed in unrelenting but contemplative instrumentation. 

Produced at Magic Gardens Studio by Gavin Monaghan and Liam Radburn. For fans of Queens of the Stone Age, Royal Blood and Arctic Monkeys.
